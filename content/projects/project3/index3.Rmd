## get data
download data from [Eurostat (Gas prices for household consumers), code = nrg_pc_202](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_pc_202/default/table?lang=en). The dataset contains gas price as for different consumption levels and times.
```{r getdata}
gas_price <- get_eurostat(id="nrg_pc_202")
glimpse(gas_price)
```

Filter data: 

* unit of measure is Gigajoule (gross calorific value)
* exclude taxes and levies
* use euro as currency
```{r tidy_data}
gas_price <- gas_price %>% 
  filter(unit == "GJ_GCV", #unit of measure = Gigajoule (gross calorific value -GCV)
         tax == "X_TAX", #excluding taxes and levies
         currency == "EUR" #currency = euro
         ) %>% 
  mutate(consumption = ifelse(consom == "4141901", "consumption<20GJ", 
                          ifelse(consom == "4141902", "20GJ<consumption<200GJ",
                                 "consumption>200GJ")))

gas_price$consumption <- factor(gas_price$consumption, 
                    ordered = TRUE,
                    levels = c("consumption<20GJ", "20GJ<consumption<200GJ",
                               "consumption>200GJ"))
```

## price by consumption volume
Gas price is lower when consumption volume is larger 
```{r consom, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
gas_price %>% 
  group_by(consumption, time) %>% 
  summarise(mean_price = mean(values, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #average gas price
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = mean_price, color = consumption)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "gas price by consumption volume",
       x = "",
       y = "gas price (euro/gigajoule)",
       caption = "Source: Eurostat, code = nrg_pc_202") +
  theme_bw() +
  NULL          
```

Then, I want to investigate are there any significant price difference between different consumption levels (`20GJ<consumption<200GJ` and `consumption>200GJ`).

After running the t test, we could see significant price difference.
```{r con_diff}
gas_price1 <- gas_price %>% 
  group_by(consumption) %>% 
  filter(consumption %in% c("20GJ<consumption<200GJ", "consumption>200GJ")) 

t.test(values ~ consumption, data = gas_price1)
```

## price by region
Liechtenstein has the highest gas price, Georgia has the lowest gas price
```{r country, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
gas_price %>% 
  filter(consom == "4141901") %>% # consumption<20GJ
  group_by(geo) %>% 
  mutate(median_price = median(values)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = values, y = reorder(geo, median_price), color = geo)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "gas price by region",
       x = "gas price (euro/gigajoule)",
       y = "",
       caption = "Source: Eurostat, code = nrg_pc_202") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  NULL          
```

## How gas price changes over time?
Average gas price increased to the highest level during 2013-2014, then decreased gradually
```{r price, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
gas_price %>% 
  group_by(time, consumption) %>% 
  summarise(mean_price = mean(values)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = mean_price)) +
  facet_wrap(~consumption) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "how gas price changes over time?",
       subtitle = "by consumption level",
       x = "",
       y = "average price (euro/gigajoule)",
       caption = "Source: Eurostat, code = nrg_pc_202") +
  theme_bw()
```
