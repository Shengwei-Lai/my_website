## get data
download data from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tour_occ_arm/default/table?lang=en)
```{r getdata}
tour_occ_arm <- get_eurostat(id="tour_occ_arm")
glimpse(tour_occ_arm)
```

I want to look at total number of arrivals at tourist accommodation establishments in France, Germany, Spain and Italy since 2000
```{r tourism}
tourism <- tour_occ_arm %>% 
  filter(c_resid == "TOTAL", #country of residence == total
         unit == "NR", #unit of measure == number
         nace_r2 == "I551-I553", #Hotels; holiday and other short-stay accommodation; camping grounds, recreational vehicle parks and trailer parks
         geo %in% c("FR", "DE", "ES", "IT"), #France, Germany, Spain, Italy
         time >= "2000-01-01") %>% 
  mutate(values = values/1000000)
```
## time seris plot
look at total number of arrivals at tourist accommodation in four countries
```{r plot}
tourism %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = values, color = geo)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~geo) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Arrivals at tourist accommodation establishments",
       subtitle = "in million",
       x = "",
       y = "millions of arrivals at tourist accommodation",
       caption = "Sources: Eurostat, code = tour_occ_arm") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## average accommodation by month
July and August have the highest number of arrivals for all four countries.
```{r mean accommodation, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
tourism %>% 
  mutate(month = month(time)) %>% 
  group_by(month, geo) %>% 
  summarise(mean_acco = mean(values)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = mean_acco, fill = geo)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~geo) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "average accommodation by month",
       subtitle = "in million",
       x = "month",
       y = "millions of arrivals at tourist accommodation",
       caption = "Sources: Eurostat, code = tour_occ_arm") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

France has the highest number of arrivals compared to other countries
```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
tourism2 <- tourism %>% 
  mutate(month = month(time)) %>% 
  group_by(month, geo) %>% 
  summarise(mean_acco = mean(values)) %>% #average accommodation per month per country
  mutate(month_acco = mean(mean_acco), #average accommodation per month for all countries
         diff = month_acco - mean_acco) 

tourism2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = month_acco), color = "black") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mean_acco + ifelse(diff>0, 0, diff),
                  ymax = month_acco),
              fill = "red", alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = month_acco,
                  ymax = mean_acco + ifelse(diff>0, diff, 0)),
              fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~geo) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "average accommodation by month",
       subtitle = "in million",
       x = "month",
       y = "millions of arrivals at tourist accommodation",
       caption = "Sources: Eurostat, code = tour_occ_arm") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## impact of Covid-19 to Italy
```{r Italy_tourism}
Italy_tourism <- tourism %>% 
  filter(geo == "IT") %>% 
  arrange(time) %>%
  #we just want to keep the values 
  select(values) %>% 
  #time series (ts) starts Jan 2000 and has monthlyfrequency (12 months/yr)
  ts(start=2000, frequency = 12) 
```

```{r}
ggseasonplot(Italy_tourism, year.labels=TRUE, year.labels.left=TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Seasonal plot: Arrivals at tourist accommodation in Italy",
    subtitle = "in millions",
    y = "Millions of Arrivals at tourist accommodation",
    caption = "Sources: Eurostat, code = tour_occ_arm"
  )+
    theme_bw()
```
