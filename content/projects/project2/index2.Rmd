download data from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/irt_euryld_m/default/table?lang=en)

yield_curve$maturity <- factor(yield_curve$maturity,
                               ordered = TRUE,
                               levels = c("Y1","Y2","Y3","Y4","Y5","Y6","Y7","Y8","Y9","Y10",
                                          "Y11","Y12","Y13","Y14","Y15","Y16","Y17","Y18","Y19",
                                          "Y20","Y21","Y22","Y23","Y24","Y25","Y26","Y27","Y28",
                                          "Y29","Y30")) #order maturity
glimpse(yield_curve)

yield_curve <- yield_curve %>% 
  mutate(year = year(time),
         month = month(time))
```

## How yield changes over time
As we can see below, the spot rate of Euro government bonds decreases gradually. In 2008 financial crisis, the yield decreased a lot (especially for short-term bonds) to save the economy, and resumed since 2010. 
Before 2012, the long-term bond yield was stable, but decreased greatly since then, mainly caused by Greece debt crisis. 
```{r yield_change, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
yield_curve %>% 
  filter(maturity %in% c("Y1", "Y5", "Y10", "Y30")) %>% 
  filter(yld_curv == "SPOT_RT", #spot rate
         bonds == "CGB_EA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = values)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~maturity) +
  labs(title = "spot yield decreases gradually",
       subtitle = "all euro area central government bonds",
       caption = "Sources: Eurostat, code = irt_euryld_m",
       x = "",
       y = "spot rate (%)") +
  theme_bw()
```

## How yield slope changes over time
During financial crisis and recessions, the yield difference of 30-year and 1-year government bonds tends to be smaller.
```{r spotrate, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
yield_curve %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "maturity",
              values_from = "values") %>% 
  mutate(slope = Y30 - Y1) %>% #calculate slope
  filter(yld_curv == "SPOT_RT", #spot rate
         bonds == "CGB_EA") %>% #all euro area central government bonds
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = slope)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "spot rate difference of 30-year and 1-year bonds",
       subtitle = "all euro area central government bonds",
       caption = "Sources: Eurostat, code = irt_euryld_m",
       x = "",
       y = "spot rate difference") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4)) +
  theme_bw()
```

## How spread changes over time
Yield spread of AAA-rated and all government bonds widened from 2010 to 2015, mainly caused by Greece debt crisis. In other times, investors believe there is little probability that governments would default their bonds.

```{r spread, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
yield_curve %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "bonds",
              values_from = "values") %>% 
  mutate(spread = CGB_EA_AAA - CGB_EA) %>% #calculate slope
  filter(yld_curv == "SPOT_RT", #spot rate
         maturity == "Y1") %>% #all euro area central government bonds
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = spread)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "yield difference of AAA-rated and all government bonds",
       subtitle = "1-year maturity",
       caption = "Sources: Eurostat, code = irt_euryld_m",
       x = "",
       y = "yield spread") +
  theme_bw()
```
